In the case of the iTunes Match service, your payment includes a publishing portion that covers both the mechanical and public performance royalties. If you do not own or control the underlying composition(s) in your sound recording(s), it is your obligation to pay these publishing royalties to the person or entity that does. Outside of the United States, Company customarily requires Consumer Stores to secure and pay for music publishing licenses (and such license fees may or may not be deducted by the Consumer Store concerned from the proceeds payable to Company). If any Consumer Store outside of the United States does not agree to secure and pay for music publishing licenses, Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to either (i) decline to license such Consumer Store or (ii) assume the responsibility to clear and pay for the music publishing licenses required in connection with such Consumer Store&rsquo;s Sales, which license fees Company shall have the right to deduct from amounts payable to you hereunder. To the extent that Company is required or elects, in its sole discretion, to pay any of the foregoing amounts, such payments will be deducted from any amounts otherwise payable to you hereunder.</span></p>

You are solely responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments arising out of any use of your Tempo Digital AB account by you or anyone else using your account. If you notify the Company in writing that you are terminating your subscription for one or more of your Recordings, no further subscription fees will be charged to your Tempo Digital AB account or Payment Method for those Recordings and all terminated Recordings will be removed from their respective Consumer Stores.
